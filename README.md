# CISERVER
This is a project for the course DD2480
Group members : Rabi Hanna, Oliver Lindblad, Hasti Mohebali Zadeh, Alexander Binett, Kaan Ucar  
This project is about implementing a CI (Continuous Integration) server by subscribing to GitHub's built-in webhooks
The CI server should send notifications whenever a push happens as well compile and run all tests on the branch where the push happened
We will also write unit tests for these CI functionalities. 
Dividing the work :
Rabi clone & build
Alexander unit tests
Hasti notification
Oliver CI compile & build for cloned repository

How to build 
mvn install 
mvn build
test cloneBranch 
testing if deleting directory works 3rd time.
